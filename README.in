## static builds

Linux 64bit


Currently some of the builds are a bit bloated,
I'm about to shrink them. 

slterm is linked with fontconfig and freetype2. 
What is imho not the slimest possiblity. Have to sort that out.

Several of the tools don't accept any options, they pipe stdin to stdout.

eg blake3sum, base32, ..
