## static builds

Linux 64bit

most tools accept -h / --help

Several of the tools don't have any options, they pipe stdin to stdout.

eg blake3sum, base32, ..

The link to these binaries is: https://github.com/michael105/static-bin/raw/refs/heads/main/toolname

(replace toolname with the tool's name. you might need to chmod a+x the downloaded file..)
